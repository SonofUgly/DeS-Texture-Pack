# DeS
Textures are .DDS DXT1 and DXT5.

The game will load indefinitely if .tpf files get too big. Because of this menu.tpf can't go above ~11.5MB, and 4K font files aren't possible.

## Models
Models are .obj with .tga textures. Renders are done with Marmoset Toolbag.

Original renders were done with high poly models, which may differ slightly from the in-game models used here, they were mirrored horizontally (not done in this), and some models, like bows, were edited and/or rendered with a weird camera setup which is hard to match.
