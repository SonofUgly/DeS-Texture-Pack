Textures are .DDS DXT1 and DXT5.

Size is limited to around 2048x2048. Installing 4096x4096 textures will cause the game to freeze during boot.

If the .tpf file has a corresponding .drb file (like menu.tpf and menu.drb) it cannot be edited without also editing the .drb, or else the game will freeze during boot.

## Models
Models are .obj with .tga textures. Renders are done with Marmoset Toolbag.

Original renders were done with high poly models, which may differ slightly from the in-game models used here, they were mirrored horizontally (not done in this), and some models, like bows, were edited and/or rendered with a weird camera setup which is hard to match.
